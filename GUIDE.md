# Welcome to the Tailify Front End Test!

The goal of this test is to show us how you can work with a remote back-end API, how you can write great code, 
how creative you are, and understanding of UI.

------------------

**Part 1**

In order to complete Part 1 of the test you will need to sign up to Pastebin and find your unique API key at 
http://pastebin.com/api. 

You will then create a front-end Javascript application which connects to https://devtest.tailify.com to fetch 
a list of images and display them in the browser. The user should be able to choose an image, and your front-end 
application will make another request to https://devtest.tailify.com in order to upload information about that 
image to your Pastebin account. 

You will be expected to display appropriate feedback to the user after the upload API call. 

The core functionality of retrieving the image list and choosing an image file to upload must be included within 
your final submission, but you also have freedom for adding any other features you feel are appropriate 
(for example you could include the option to search for similar images on Google or to post the image to Twitter)

You can find a GitHub repository containing the back-end API code at https://github.com/tailify/dev-test-api 
which includes example API calls and responses. You do not need to install the back-end code, 
it is provided purely for your reference.

Point to note: You don’t have to actually upload an image file to our API, you only need to tell our API which 
image the user has selected. Nor do you need to upload anything directly to Pastebin. Think of our API as a 
CORS-friendly proxy for Pastebin. You WILL run into CORS issues if you try to upload directly to Pastebin 
and you WILL end up wasting your time!

------------------

**Part 2**

In order to complete Part 2, you will visually display data retrieved from one of our campaigns. 

Essentially, create a campaign report (think infographic). The data is attached as an excel file "Data for Tailify 
Front End Test". Feel free to display it in whatever way you see fit, and display it on the same page as for part 1, 
or separate; it's up to you. Points are given for interactivity.

------------------

**General notes**

The design is up to you. Ultimately we’re looking for something which is easy to use but not boring.

The JS framework you choose is entirely your choice. We have a preference for React, but Angular, Vue, or anything 
else will be just fine as long as you use it appropriately.

Top tip: Your code should be modular, well-written, and tested. You should include a readme file which includes 
step-by-step instructions on how to replicate your project for using & testing (make it easy for us to appreciate 
your creativity!)

You may submit your code by sending us a Github, BitBucket, or any other source code management tool link 
(please send the link to lee.marshall@tailify.com). Clear & descriptive commit messages will earn bonus points. 
You can keep committing to the repository after sending us the link (e.g. if you want to send us the link immediately 
so we can see your progress as you build your application), but you should have the test completed within 48 hours 
of starting.

**Good Luck**
